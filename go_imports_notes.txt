# Notes on Go imports

if we're using modules, just skip gopath
    i assume we still check in goroot for stdlib


internal directories: if we have the tree
    $GOPATH
        src/
            foo/  # this is a package
                internal/
                    bar/
        pkg/
        bin/

then only files under foo's tree can import "foo/internal/bar"

read:
When using modules, downloaded packages are stored in the module cache.
(See 'go help module-get' and 'go help goproxy'.)
