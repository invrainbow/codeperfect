When you open a function call by typing `(`, if CodePerfect detects that the
thing preceding it is a function, it will read its signature and show it to
you:

![](/parameter-hint.png)

If the parameter hint has been closed, and you type a `,` with your cursor
inside a function call, it will also re-open the hint.

\* The hint opens automatically as you type, but you can also manually trigger
it with your cursor inside a function call after you've closed it.
