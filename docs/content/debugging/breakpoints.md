Breakpoints let you pause the execution of your program at certain points so
you can inspect what's happening.

CodePerfect currently supports line-based breakpoints. Move your cursor over
the line you want to set a breakpoint on, and run <cite>Debug</cite> &gt;
<cite>Toggle Breakpoint</cite>.

Breakpoints cause the line they're on to be highlighted red. When the program
is stopped on a breakpoint (or on any line), it turns yellow.

## Delete All Breakpoints

To delete all breakpoints, run <cite>Debug</cite> &gt; <cite>Delete All Breakpoints</cite>.
