CodePerfect indexes every toplevel declaration in your code. To jump to one,
press <kbd>âŒ˜T</kbd>.

![](/go-to-symbol.png)

This lets you fuzzy-search for any symbol in your code, with each symbol keyed
as `package.identifier`. Method declarations are keyed as
`package.receiver.method`. Because of the flexibility of fuzzy search, you
can search for just the `identifier`, the entire `package.identifier`, or any
fuzzy substring.
