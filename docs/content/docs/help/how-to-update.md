## Check for outdated packages

The [`npm outdated`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-outdated) command will check the registry to see if any (or, specific) installed packages are currently outdated:

```bash
npm outdated [[<@scope>/]<pkg> ...]
```

## Update packages

The [`npm update`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-update) command will update all the packages listed to the latest version (specified by the tag config), respecting semver:

```bash
npm update [<pkg>...]
```
