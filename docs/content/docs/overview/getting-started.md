CodePerfect 95 is an IDE for Go. It is designed to be cross-platform, and
currently supports Windows and macOS. Linux support is on the way.

We offer a free 30-day trial for non-commercial use. After that you'll need to
purchase a subscription, which currently costs $5/month per user for
individuals, and $10/month if your company is buying it for you.

CodePerfect 95 is currently in semi-open beta -- please email
support@codeperfect95.com to get started.
