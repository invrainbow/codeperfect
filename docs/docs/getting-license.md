title: Getting a License
---

CodePerfect is free to use for a 7-day evaluation period. This will activate the
first time you run CodePerfect on your machine. After that, a license key is
needed for further use. You can purchase one
[here](https://codeperfect95.com/buy).

A key has two parts: a one-time perpetual license, and
subscription-based automatic updates. You can choose either one, or both:

- **License only**
  - A perpetual license locked to a particular version.
  - After 3 included months of updates, locked to the final version.
- **License and subscription**
  - A perpetual license with access to ongoing updates .
  - When your subscription ends, your perpetual license is locked to the final
    version.
- **Subscription only**
  - Access to the software during your subscription.
  - You lose access when your subscription ends.

By design, we intend to monetize primarily through developers expensing the
purchase with their employers. If you're paying as an individual, the price is
significantly discounted.

After you buy a license key, we'll send it to the email you entered during
checkout. Please contact us at
[support@codeperfect95.com](mailto:support@codeperfect95.com) if you don't get
it. Once you have it, open CodePerfect and go to `Help` &gt; `Enter License`.

If you want to change licenses after having previously entered a different one,
go to `Help` &gt; `Re-enter License`.
