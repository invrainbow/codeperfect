title: Getting a License
---

CodePerfect is free to use for a 7-day evaluation period. This will activate the
first time you run CodePerfect on your machine.

After that, a license key is needed for further use. You can purchase one
[here](https://codeperfect95.com/buy). It's $5/month for individuals, and
$10/month for companies (or if you want to expense the purchase). You get two
months off if you buy an annual license.

After you buy a license, we'll send your license key to the email you entered
during checkout. Please contact us at
[support@codeperfect95.com](mailto:support@codeperfect95.com) if you don't get
it.

Once you have your license key, open CodePerfect and go to `Help` &gt;
`Enter License`. Enter your email and license key. If you want to change
licenses after having previously entered a different one, go to `Help` &gt;
`Re-enter License`.
