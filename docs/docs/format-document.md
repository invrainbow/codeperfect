title: "Format Document"

When you save a file, CodePerfect automatically formats your file using
`goimports`. This is managed for you; you don't need to install `goimports`.

To manually format your document, run `Format` &gt; `Format File`.

By default, Format File does _not_ automatically add and remove imports. To
format with import organization, run `Format` &gt; `Format File and Organize
Imports`. This organizes imports using our native implementation, which uses our
in-memory index to provide faster and more accurate results.
