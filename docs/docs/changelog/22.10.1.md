title: Release 22.10.1

October 9, 2022

- Fixed debugger issues. The time delay in between stepping should be
  substantially shorter, and the bottom panel with the variables/watches no
  longer flashes while rapidly stepping through.

- Fixed crash relating to autocomplete.

- Fixed copying in Vim mode. Previously copying while in line-based visual mode
  would copy as if you were in regular visual node, instead of copying the whole
  line. Now it works as expected.

- Fixed bug with generics where certain expressions were not being evaluated
  correctly.

- Added [tree-based navigation](/tree-based-navigation). Now you can navigate the current file using its
  syntax tree.

  - Press Ctrl+Alt+A (or run the `Enter Tree-Based Navigation` command) to enter AST
    navigation mode.
  - Use the hjkl or arrow keys to move:
    - up/down to move to previous/next sibling
    - left to move to the parent
    - right to move to the first child
  - Press Escape to leave tree-based navigation mode.
