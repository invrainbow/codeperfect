New features to deal with interfaces and navigate your codebase more fluidly.
Vim mode is now optional; users who prefer a traditional editor now have the
option.

## Handling interfaces

We're releasing a triplet of features to help you deal with interfaces in your
codebase more easily:

- [Generate Implementation](/generate-implementation). This lets you select an
  interface and a type, and generate all the methods needed for that type to
  implement the interface.

- [Find Interfaces](/find-interfaces). This lets you select a type, and find
  interfaces that it implements.

- [Find Implementations](/find-implementations). This lets you select an
  interface, and find types that implement it.

All of these features can be accessed through the
[Command Palette](/command-palette).

## Find References

[Find References](/find-references)Â lets you search for all references to a
given identifier. This can be accessed through the
[Command Palette](/command-palette).

## Fixes and improvements

- Added support for multiple build and debug profiles.

- Added normal non-Vim mode. Now you can use CodePerfect without using Vim
  keybindings. Previously, there was no option to turn them off.
