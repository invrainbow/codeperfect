title: Release 23.01

January 25, 2023

- Added
  [support for Workspaces](https://dev-docs.codeperfect95.com/getting-started#projects).
  - You can now open a folder containing a go.work, or with a go.work in one of
    its parents. (Basically, if `go env GOWORK` can find it, it should work.)
  - Opening a single module (a folder with a go.mod file at its root) works like
    before.
  - If you open a module that belongs to a workspace somewhere in one of its
    parents, it will understand that it is part of a workspace, and work
    correctly.
- Added `Ctrl+E` and `Ctrl+A` shortcuts on macOS in non-Vim mode.
- Fixed bug with `nil` being incorrectly parsed.
- Added syntax highlighting for go.mod and go.work files.
- Updated to latest version of ImGui.
- Fixed an elusive, longstanding bug where Neovim and internal buffer would
  become out of sync and cause a crash.
- Added confirmation asking to save unsaved file when exiting via Cmd+Q on
  macOS.
- Added support for multiple instances of Delve. Previously the Delve port was
  hardcoded and if that port was blocked (e.g. by an existing instance of Delve)
  it would simply fail. Now it looks for the next available port. This also
  enables multiple instances of CodePerfect to debug programs simultaneously.
