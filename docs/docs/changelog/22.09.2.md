Setember 16, 2022

This release consists of further bugfixes and improvements.

- **Experimental:** Added "Generate Function From Call" command. This command
  takes a call to a function that doesn't exist yet, and generates the function
  prototype based on the arguments passed in. This works with regular functions,
  object methods, and functions in other packages, as long as they reside in
  your workspace.

- Fixed crash relating to Vim plugin.

- Fixed `Type(x)` typecasts not being handled correctly in code intelligence.

- Added `Ctrl+F` and `Ctrl+B` in Vim mode.

- Fixed `Ctrl+D` and `Ctrl+U` in Vim mode. Previously the jump distance would be
  unpredictable and inconsistent. Now it jumps correctly based on the size of
  the buffer inside lCodePerfect.
