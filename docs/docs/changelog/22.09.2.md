Setember 16, 2022

This release consists of further bugfixes and improvements.

- **Experimental:** Added "Generate Function From Call" command. This command
  takes a call to a function that doesn't exist yet, and generates the function
  prototype based on the arguments passed in. This works with regular functions,
  object methods, and functions in other packages, as long as they reside in
  your workspace.

- Fixed crash relating to Vim plugin.

- Fix `Type(x)` typecasts not being handled correctly in code intelligence.

- Add `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+U`, `Ctrl+F`, and `Ctrl+B` in Vim mode.
