October 4, 2022

- Fixed bug where all editors would scroll whenever mouse was scrolled
  regardless of where cursor was.

- Improved color and style of toplevel firstline preview.

- Added support for dot imports (`import . "foo"`) in code intelligence.
  `Optimize Imports` also does the correct thing now.

- Fixed bug with scrolling by dragging cursor past top or bottom of editor.
  Before, the first time you started scrolling after a long time, it would
  instantly jump all the way up/down. Now it does the correct thing.

- Improved scrollbar style.

- Fixed scrollbar rendering bug.

- Fixed issues with debugger crashing randomly and flashing distractingly while
  stepping.

- Fixed application lagging significantly whenever the window was resized.

- Fixed (rare) undefined behavior where parts of the editor would randomly be
  highlighted.
