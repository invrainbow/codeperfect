title: Release 22.09.7

Setember 30, 2022

- Fixed scrolling and dragging with the mouse in the editor. Scrolling by
  dragging past the top & bottom edges now works.

- Fixed cursor being difficult to see when cursor is at the start of a
  selection.

- Improved rendering of rounded rectangles. Made block cursor (in Vim mode)
  slightly rounded.

- Added scrollbar to editor.

- Fixed toplevel first line preview. Previously, it was overlaid on top of the
  editor, obstructing the first couple lines. Now it exists in a separate bar
  dedicated to the preview. In the future, other useful things may go here.

- Added Home, End, PgDn, and PgUp keys in non-Vim mode.

- Fixed crash relating to trying to save a deleted file while "Organize imports
  after formatting" is enabled.

- Added `Go Back` and `Go Forward` commands with accompanying keyboard shortcuts.
  This activates the same functionality that already is already binded to `C-o`
  and `C-i` in Vim mode, but is now accessible in both Vim and non-Vim mode.

- Fixed Optimize Imports removing blank imports like `import _ "embed"`.

- Added each individual build profile and debug profile to the Command Palette.
