## Improvements and changes

- The first line preview of your current toplevel scope (that displays when the
  first line is offscreen) is now clickable, and takes you to the first line.

- The Command Palette now shows the last command run if the search query is
  empty (e.g. right when you open the window).

- Changed the indicator showing when the debugger is running. Now the entire
  menubar changes color, and the debugger state is displayed on the right side
  of the menubar.

- Added ability for CodePerfect to restart itself. Now when you change a setting
  that requires a restart (e.g. enabling Vim keybindings), or entering a license
  key, CodePerfect offers to restart for you.

## Bugfixes

- Fix crash caused by a syntax error involving a nonexistent function receiver.

- Fix crash related to generics.

- Fixed bug where `C-e` and `C-y` were working in non-Vim mode.

- Fixed mouse interactions in the editor, where simply holding down mouse button
  near the bottom of the screen would cause infinite scrolling.

- Fixed bug related to generics where autocomplete would fail.
