This release consists of more bugfixes.

- Fixed jump to definition of field in struct literal not working.

- Fixed very narrow bug where jump to definition on a) function parameter b)
  with generic type c) in a method declaration d) with a generic receiver was
  not working.
- Fixed internal format of code index to distinguish between null and empty
  lists. This fixes a jump to definition bug in certain cases.
