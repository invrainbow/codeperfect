title: Release 23.09
---

September 16, 2023

I've stopped developing CodePerfect and moved on to other things, so I'm now
[open-sourcing](https://github.com/codeperfect95/codeperfect) it and making it
free. All active subscriptions will be refunded on a prorated basis.

Not much in the way of functionality has changed, except that authentication and
licensing have been removed. The launcher has also been removed as there's no
more need for autoupdate and crash reporting.

Socials have been closed down, website and docs have been updated, and in
general everything is being wound down in a pretty predictable fashion.

Thank you for all of your support over the lifetime of CodePerfect!
