title: Release 22.09
---

Setember 6, 2022

CodePerfect is relaunching after six months in R&D! It'd be hard to list
everything that's happened, but the big themes are:

- **Cross-platform support.** Mac (Intel/M1) and Windows (x64) are now
  supported. Linux support is coming soon pending a persistent GTK-related bug
  that we're working through.

- **Unicode support.** Unicode is now supported in the text editor. It is not
  yet supported in the surrounding UI (e.g. the _Go To Symbol_ window); we're
  working on that.

- **Generics support.** We're releasing beta-stage support for generics across
  all of our code intelligence features. We expect bugs; please do
  [report them](https://github.com/codeperfect95/issue-tracker).

- **Improved stability.** We fixed over a hundred bugs and did a bunch of
  testing. Of course, inevitably there are more bugs to be found. Please do
  [report them](https://github.com/codeperfect95/issue-tracker).
