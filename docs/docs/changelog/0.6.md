This release fixes a bug where CodePerfect would fail to find the Go binary, and
exit.

## Finding the Go binary

CodePerfect finds the Go binary by basically running `which go` in a Bash shell,
i.e. `bash -lc "which go"`. Unfortunately, we omitted the `-i` flag for turning
on interactive mode, causing it to ignore many users' `.bashrc` files that were
responsible for adding the `go` path to `$PATH`.

We've fixed this by adding the `-i` flag.
