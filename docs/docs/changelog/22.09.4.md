Setember 24, 2022

This emergency release fixes a bug that was introduced recently, resulting in
sporadic crashes. It also comes with a couple features and more minor bugfixes.

## Main bugfix

Fixed bug relating to indexer that was causing sporadic crashes.

## Other features and bugfixes

- Fixed bug where holding down the mouse above the scroll offset would cause an
  endless loop of scrolling.

- Added feature showing the first line of the current toplevel scope, if it is
  offscreen. This lets you easily see what block of code you're editing, and in
  the case of functions, the function parameters.
