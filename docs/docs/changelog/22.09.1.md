Setember 13, 2022

This release consists of bugfixes and improvements.

- Added settings to enable/disable auto format on save, and optionally organize
  imports as well.

- Fixed crash when unrecognized keys were pressed (such as the fn/globe key on
  Mac).

- Organize Imports now preserves `import "C"`.

- Fixed const declarations using `iota` not being recognized.

- Fixed crash when trying to dot-autocomplete `it.`, where `it` is the index of
  a `range` expression: `for it := range ...`

- Support `range` over channels.

- Improved Find References. The UI is cleaned up and now also shows the name of
  the declaration that the reference resides in.
