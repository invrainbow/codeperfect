title: Release 23.02
---

February 1, 2023

This release consists mainly of bugfixes and minor features.

- Fixed bug with zooming causing mouse position to be reported incorrectly.
- Fixed bug with UI keyboard input becoming unresponsive if window is unfocused
  while Ctrl is pressed.
- Added ability to change framerate limit.
- Updated to try using fonts from the OS before using the hardcoded builtin
  font. However, on macOS, it currently uses Lucida Grande instead of the
  default system UI font (San Francisco) because for some reason the latter
  looks slightly strange in our app. (We're working on it.)
- Made CodePerfect open the last folder on startup. This can be disabled in
  `Options` > `Open last folder on startup`.
- Added ability to open a new instance from current instance, using `File` >
  `Open Folder...`.
- Fixed bug with Find References crashing.
