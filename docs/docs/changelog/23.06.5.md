This patch fixes a couple more bugs:

- Separated Format Document from Organize Imports. You can now do either individually, or both, or neither, on save.
- Made Organize Imports sort imports properly.
- Fixed bug where type assertions with a pointer type was causing some errors.
- Fixed workflow bug where main editor would be defocused after a build.
- Fixed tab names for files from third-party packages.
- Made popup menus (in the menu bar, or from right clicking) closable with the Escape key.
- Fixed bug where third-party packages, which are read-only, could sometimes be edited.
- Fixed `$` vim movement erroneously capturing a trailing newline.
- Made Debug Output focus when starting to debug, and Call Stack focus when program is paused.
