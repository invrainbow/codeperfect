This patch fixes several bugs and changes the way we handle crash reporting.

### Bugs

- Fixed memory corruption error inside the indexer. We had forgotten to copy an
  essential data structure out of our ephemeral arena and into our persistent
  arena.

- Fixed crash in the way previous builds were being cleaned up when a second
  build was run.

### Crash reporting

Previously, we had our own homegrown crash reporter using `signal()` that
generated a stacktrace. On the next run, the IDE would send the stacktrace to
the server (if the `Send crash reports` setting was enabled). This was brittle
and often broke, as custom crash reporters often are and do.

The new version just grabs the crash report that Apple conveniently generates
for us, and sends that instead.
