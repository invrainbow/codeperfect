### Find interfaces

Given a type, CodePerfect can find all interfaces that it implements. Put your
cursor over the type, and run `Find Interfaces`.

:::tip

By default, empty interfaces are excluded, since every type implements the empty
interface. If you want to show them, check `Show Empty Interfaces`.

### Find implementations

Given an interface, CodePerfect can find all types that implement it. Put your cursor
over the interface, and run `Find Implementations`.
