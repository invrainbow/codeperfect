Breakpoints let you pause the execution of your program at certain points so
you can inspect what's happening.

CodePerfect currently supports line-based breakpoints. Move your cursor over
the line you want to set a breakpoint on, and run `Debug` &gt;
`Toggle Breakpoint`.

Breakpoints cause the line they're on to be highlighted red. When the program
is stopped on a breakpoint (or on any line), it turns yellow.

## Delete All Breakpoints

To delete all breakpoints, run `Debug` &gt; `Delete All Breakpoints`.
