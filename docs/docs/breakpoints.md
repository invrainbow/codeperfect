title: "Breakpoints"
---

Breakpoints let you pause the execution of your program at certain points so you
can inspect what's happening.

CodePerfect currently supports line-based breakpoints. Move your cursor over the
line you want to set a breakpoint on, and run `Debug` &gt; `Toggle Breakpoint`.

Breakpoints cause the line they're on to be highlighted red. When the program is
stopped on a breakpoint (or on any line), it turns yellow.

## Delete All Breakpoints

To delete all breakpoints, run `Debug` &gt; `Delete All Breakpoints`.
