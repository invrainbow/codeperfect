When you open a function call by typing `(`, if the thing preceding it is a
function, CodePerfect will show you its signature:

![](/parameter-hint.png)

When you type a `,` inside a function call, it will re-open the hint.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Command               | Shortcut              |

\* The hint opens automatically as you type, but you can also manually trigger
it with your cursor inside a function call after you've closed it.
