# Start a Build

Ensure the correct build profile is selected. Go to `Build` &gt;
`Select Active Build Profile...` and select your build profile. Then run `Build`
&gt; `Start Build`.

You can also trigger a build for a particular profile without setting it as the
active profile, by opening the command palette and searching for
`Build: <the build profile name>`.

When you build, the Build Results window will pop up at the bottom of the
screen. When the build is finished, if successful, the window will simply
disappear. If the build failed, errors will be displayed here. See
[Navigating Errors](navigating-errors) for more information.
