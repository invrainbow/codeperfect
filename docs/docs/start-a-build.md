# Start a Build

Ensure the correct build profile is selected. Run `Build` &gt;
`Select Active Build Profile...` and select your build profile. Then run `Build`
&gt; `Start Build`.

The Build Results window will pop up at the bottom of the screen. When the build
is finished, if successful, the window will simply disappear. If the build
failed, errors will be displayed here. See
