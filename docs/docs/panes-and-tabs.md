title: "Panes and Tabs"
---

CodePerfect supports panes and tabs. Panes are vertical splits that let you edit
two files side by side. Each pane can contain several tabs.

Move between panes by pressing `Cmd+1` for pane #1, `Cmd+2` for pane #2, and so on, up to 4 panes.

Panes can be resized by dragging the border between panes with your mouse.
