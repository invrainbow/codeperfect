title: "Setting Up the Debugger"

CodePerfect integrates with the Delve debugger, allowing you to debug your
programs directly from inside CodePerfect.

## Prerequisites

You'll need [the Delve debugger](https://github.com/go-delve/delve). You can
install the latest version from their
[docs](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/installation/README.md).

Make sure Delve is installed correctly by opening a terminal and running
`which dlv` on Mac and `where dlv` on Windows. If it's not able to find it, you
may need to update your `PATH`.

:::info

CodePerfect locates the `dlv` binary the same way. You don't need to configure
anything else â€” just run `which dlv` in bash on Mac and `where dlv` in cmd on
Windows, and make sure it prints out the right path.

## Configuring the debugger

To get started, run `Debug` &gt; `Debug Profiles`.

The list on the left lets you add, remove, and select profiles. Each profile is
a piece of configuration that tells CodePerfect how to debug your program.

There are currently four supported profile types:

### Test Function Under Cursor

> This is used for the [Test Function Under Cursor](debug-a-test) feature, which
> lets you debug an individual test. CodePerfect comes with a built-in profile
> of this type, which can't be removed, except to add command-line arguments.
> You can add additional profiles of this type.
>
> The settings allow you to add command-line arguments.

### Run Package

> This profile lets you run and debug a `main` package.
>
> The settings allow you to either configure the package path, or to use
> whatever package the current file is located in. You can also add command-line
> arguments.

### Run Binary

> This profile lets you run and debug a binary built with `go build`.
>
> The settings allow you to specify a path to the binary as well as extra
> command-line arguments.

### Test Package

> This profile lets you run and debug all the tests in a package.
>
> The settings allow you to either configure the package path, or to just use
> whatever package the current file is located in.
