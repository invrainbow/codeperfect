title: "Find and Replace"
---

You can find and replace within a file using `Cmd+F` and `Cmd+H`, respectively.

Searching for something will cause search results to be highlighted. To clear
search results, press `Ctrl+/`.

To jump between find results, use `F3` and `Shift+F3`.

## Vim integration

You can press `/` to bring up the Find window, and `n` `N` `*` `#` all work as
expected.
