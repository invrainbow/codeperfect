title: "Command Palette"

Press `Cmd+K` anywhere to open the Command Palette, similar to
`Cmd+Shift+P` in VSCode. This lets you fuzzy-search for commands to run.

Any command that is accessible from the menu bar, including all commands
referenced in the docs, can alternatively be run by opening the Command Palette
and searching for the command.

If a command has a keyboard shortcut, the Command Palette will also display it.

Commands that aren't runnable in the current context are excluded. For instance,
if you don't have an editor open, `Save File` won't show up.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Command                | Shortcut    |
