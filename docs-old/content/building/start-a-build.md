Ensure the correct build profile is selected. Run <cite>Build</cite> &gt; <cite>Select Active Build
Profile...</cite> and select your build profile. (Currently, only one hardcoded
profile is allowed. So select that one.)

To start the build, run <cite>Build</cite> &gt; <cite>Start Build</cite>.

The Build Results window will pop up at the bottom of the screen. When the
build is finished, if successful, the window will simply disappear. If the
build failed, errors will be displayed here. See [Navigating
Errors](/building/navigating-errors) for more information.
