CodePerfect can find all interfaces that a given type implements. Put your
cursor over the type, and run <cite>Navigate</cite> &gt; <cite>Find
Interfaces</cite>.

This will open results in a new panel.

By default, empty interfaces are excluded, since every type implements the
empty interface. If you want to show them, check Show Empty Interfaces.
