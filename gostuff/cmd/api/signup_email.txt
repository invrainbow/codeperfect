{{.Greeting}},

Thanks for signing up for the CodePerfect beta! The next step is to schedule a
30-minute onboarding call, where we'll:

* Go over what projects you're working on
* Install CodePerfect over screenshare
* Walk through features and see how they fit into your workflow

To hold your spot, we ask for a card to keep on file. We won't charge anything
until after your free 7-day trial is over, and you can cancel at any time.

You can schedule your call here:

Looking forward to it,
Brandon
