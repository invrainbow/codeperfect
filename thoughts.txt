Our core advantage by intent is: work with a tiny team (right now just me) to
reduce/eliminate overhead; spend ALL of our time working on things that
actually matter, instead of stupid "serious-sounding" stuff; and program in a
non-stupid way (the jblow way) to be able to ship features like crazy (it's
slow at first, but after the 20kloc mark we're going to enter warp speed).

So it is worth thinking hard about what this set of "right things" is.

I wish C++ had a more obvious syntax that you're declaring a lambda/closure
inside a function. Right now you have to read all the way to the [&] to
realize.

Philosphically, how much do we want users to be involved in/know about the
internal workings of Raven?  With a tool like an IDE, having a mental map of
the inner workings of the tool is part of using the tool effectively.
