CodePerfect is a fast Go IDE, built from scratch in C/C++/OpenGL like a video
game. It starts instantly, runs at 144 FPS, has near-zero latency, and comes
with native, full-featured code intelligence and integrated debugging with
Delve. See more features [here](https://docs.codeperfect95.com).

It's no longer actively developed, but is now open source and free. It only
supports MacOS; there are no plans to port it.

#### Build

```bash
sh/install_deps   # Install dependencies
sh/build          # Build raw binary to ./build
sh/package        # Build CodePerfect.app (and zip) to ./scratch
```
