There isn't any one single thing. CodePerfect gets its speed largely by
declining to copy all the extreme bloat that makes the modern tech stack slow.
In particular, we:

1. Use a low level language (C/C++) and render our own UI with OpenGL.
2. Eschew large dependencies like Electron, language servers, etc.
3. Write simple, linear-control-flow, straightforward,
   <a href={LINKS.nonPessimized}>non-pessimized</a> code, without unnecessary
   abstractions or patterns.
4. Amortize memory allocations with arenas.

We especially try to limit use of third-party libraries and frameworks in order
to own our entire stack, and maintain visibility into every line of code that
goes into the final product. Much of the slowness of modern software comes not
from this slow algorithm or that inefficient data structure, but from all the
invisible bloat hidden inside the mainstream default software stack.

We're not writing crazy inline assembly or SIMD intrinsics or discovering new
algorithms or whatever. We do some optimization, like using file mappings and
multithreading stuff where it makes sense, but mostly we are just writing
straightforward code that performs the actual task of executing an IDE. Modern
computers are just fast.
