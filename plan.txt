1/12/21
    plan:
        - n/a
    done:
        - finished streamlit and overview
        - worked a little on IDE, not enough
        - got imports sync working
    todo:
        - the rest of our index
    notes:
        - i am hungry

1/11/21
    plan:
        - 7am - wake up, work on IDE
        - 9am - call with overview, work on his shit
        - 11am - streamlit meetings, finish streamlit stuff
        - 3pm - work on IDE until sleep
        - 6pm - exercise, eat
        - goal: get indexing system working, have it correctly gather import
          paths and build index. already have most of the pieces, just write the
          necessary code.
    done:
        - woke up late, didn't get up at 7am to work on IDE
        - stayed on top of streamlit and overview
        - did not work on IDE.
    todo:
        - work on IDE!
    notes:
        - work on IDE!

1/10/21
    plan:
        - get indexing system working, have it correctly gather import paths
          and build index.
        - stretch: maybe start on rebuilding index when import paths, files, or
          dependencies change
        - do IDE work in the morning, freelance in the afteronon, then IDE till
          sleep.
    done:
        - i didn't really work on IDE today. filled out main_loop() a bit more,
        not much.
    todo:
        - same as start of day really
    notes:
        - start getting into strict schedule tomorrow

1/9/21
    plan:
        - really hope to get find_decl_in_index working
        - first we have to understand go imports
        - maybe have to start building out v2 of indexer
        - i still have stupid contracting shit to finish
    done:
        - created String_Set for removing duplicates
        - mapped out a plan/process for our index to follow
            - see huge comment at top of go.cpp
        - early proto of Index::main_loop() with import path checking
    todo:
        - build out the index now
    notes:
        - i'm feeling optimistic, this seems entirely doable.
        - just keep working on the IDE, improve your discipline more and more,
          and stay on top of employment (shouldn't be hard, at most 3-4 hours a
          day total)
        - before thought find_decl_in_index was a few lines away, now know it's
          going to require completion of our `Index` class.

1/8/21
    plan:
        - finish researching and really understand/build a model of go imports
        - get find_decl_in_index() working
        - tomorrow's schedule: ide until first call, streamlit until standup, ide after
    done:
        - messed around with dev setup some more (need to start real work)
        - >:(
    todo:
        - get find_decl_in_index working (precursor to that is to figure out model of imports)
    notes:
        - i think i'll go for per-project indexes
        - do we just aggressively autoindex goroot, gopath, and vendor all at once?
          or index what we're importing?

1/7/21
    plan:
        - get find_decl_in_index() working
    done:
        - seamless edit/build/debug cycle now
        - Index_Reader::find_decl is now working, just need find_decl_in_index now
    todo:
        - ran into hurdle implementing find_decl_in_index re: resolving import
          paths. in particular, once we learn from the index what the filename
          and position are, we need to know where to find it. from there i realized
          actually idk much about import resolution, so need to keep reading;
          see go_imports_notes.txt notes:
    notes:
        - i should fix naysayer88.vim, the pink autocomplete in command bar
          looks like shit

1/6/21
    plan:
        - n/a
    done:
        - read/write indexes
        - remove dependency on visual studio for build
    todo:
        - index to actually look up decls in intellisense
        - check out remedybg
