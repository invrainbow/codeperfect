[idea] Log window. A kind of log window showing what's happening behind the
scenes, but not autistic developer debug notes -- stuff that actually allows
the user to build a model of how their tool is working and a closer
relationship with the IDE. For example, "detected import, now indexing ___".

[idea] Context-aware autocomplete, including, if you're in a toplevel, all you
can write is func, const, var, and type.

Create a string class.

COME UP WITH A GOOD NAME.

Use our allocator for uthash_malloc.

Right now, when we call make_file_ast on the current file during autocomplete
or gotodef, we assume current package name is world.wksp.go_import_path. This
will fail if user edits files outside current workspace. Need function to
translate directory path into import path. Update: world.wksp.go_import_path
has been replaced with get_workspace_import_path().

Now that our memory isn't retarded anymore, rework Scoped_Table to not use
LIST_MALLOC. And also just rewrite large sections of Parser.

See how many LIST_MALLOCs should just be LIST_POOLs.

Handle unicode. If we don't handle the stupid Unicode situation soon, we're
going to be fucked the longer we wait. Need to get that shit over with.
Probably the first thing we need to do as soon as indexing is done.

Handle nested vendor directories for Go too. And nested go.mod.

[bug] Syntax highlighting is weird/slow/jumpy.

Add syntax highlighting to parameter hint.

[bug] When you maximize the window, it doesn't resize the editor.

[bug] When autocomplete opens, as you type, the menu should stay at the same
spot it opened, not follow you.

[bug] When you resize a pane too small, it ruins syntax highlighting.
