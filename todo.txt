Ideas
=====

Log window. A kind of log window showing what's happening behind the
scenes, but not autistic developer debug notes -- stuff that actually allows
the user to build a model of how their tool is working and a closer
relationship with the IDE. For example, "detected import, now indexing ___".

Context-aware autocomplete, including, if you're in a toplevel, all you
can write is func, const, var, and type.


Tasks
=====

Create a string class.

COME UP WITH A GOOD NAME.

Use our allocator for uthash_malloc.

Now that our memory isn't retarded anymore, rework Scoped_Table to not use
LIST_MALLOC. And also just rewrite large sections of Parser.

See how many LIST_MALLOCs should just be LIST_POOLs.

Handle unicode. If we don't handle the stupid Unicode situation soon, we're
going to be fucked the longer we wait. Need to get that shit over with.
Probably the first thing we need to do as soon as indexing is done.

Handle nested vendor directories for Go too. And nested go.mod.

Basic highlighting of the current parameter hint param already exists, but it's
broken (you'll see). Fix it, and add more detailed syntax highlighting (like
the type).

Since we depend so heavily on the index for all aspects of intellisense (e.g.
find_decl_of_id relies on it directly), we MUST invalidate the index as soon as
a file changes.

Make sure list_methods_in_type also checks methods in embedded fields of
structs.

Enable adding new files/folder in file explorer.

Our neovim integration gives complete access to :commands, /search, etc. Think
about how we should handle this. Also, Vim highlights when I search for stuff
are weird.

Make autocomplete on a blank line include accessible decls in current file.

A group of changes needs to be made to fix a large class of problems.
 - Hand-roll our own syntax parser (stop using nvim's)
 - In insert mode, handle input ourselves
This can be done in order.
 - [x] Turn off current syntax highlighting
 - [x] Get native input handling working
 - [ ] Write our own syntax highlighter.
I predict this will stop about 80% of our stupid random crashes. nvim should
really only be used to handle the stuff nvim excels at, namely, normal-mode
commands.

In insert mode, make closing brace de-indent.

Make our new insert mode handle multiple insert points, like ctrl-v + s.

Add nested parameter hints.



Bugs
====

When tabs overflow the tab bar, current tab just goes offscreen.

When you press tab to fill in autocomplete without typing any prefix, it
autocompletes, but leaves the menu open (and moves it to your cursor).

Typing "foo(bar(" will use autocomplete for foo, not bar.



Purgatory
=========

[bug?] Go_Index reindexes twice whenever we save a file.  Update: I mean, the
debounce stops it from reindexing twice, but savig a file still sends two
filesystem change events. Not sure if worth fixing.

Earlier, when typing a literal value, it got into an infinite loop,
presumably inside parse_literal_value (judging by both the context of the crash
and also the error message it was printing out was from eat_comma). Can't
repro right now, but it's there.
